                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        AB KICKS LLC is committed to delivering your LEGO® sets safely and securely. 
                        This shipping policy outlines our procedures, rates, and guidelines for 
                        shipping orders.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Shipping Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        We ship via the following carriers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>
                        The carrier used for your order will depend on the size, weight, and 
                        destination of your package, as well as the shipping speed you select.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Processing Time</h2>

                        During peak seasons or high-volume periods, processing may take up to 3 
                        business days. You'll receive an email with tracking information once your 
                        order has shipped.

                    <h2>Shipping Destinations</h2>

                    <h2>Package Protection & Handling</h2>
                    <p>
                        We understand that box condition is important to collectors. Every LEGO® set 
                        we ship is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wrapped in protective bubble wrap or foam</li>
                        <li>Placed in a sturdy shipping box with adequate cushioning</li>
                        <li>Marked as fragile when appropriate</li>
                        <li>Double-boxed for larger or more valuable sets</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tracking Your Order</h2>
                    <p>
                        All shipments include tracking. You'll receive a tracking number via email 
                        once your order ships. You can use this number to monitor your package's 
                        progress on the carrier's website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Delivery Issues</h2>
                    <h3>Lost Packages</h3>

                        If you need to change your shipping address, please contact us immediately. 
                        Once an order has shipped, we may not be able to change the delivery address. 
                        In such cases, you may need to work directly with the carrier to redirect 
                        the package.
                    </p>
