                    <p>
                        At AB KICKS LLC, we want you to have a great experience purchasing from us. 
                        Please review our policies below.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        We ship all LEGO® sets via USPS, UPS, or FedEx, depending on the size and 
                        weight of your order. All packages are carefully packaged to protect the 
                        sealed box condition during transit.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Shipping Rates</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard Shipping (5-7 business days): Calculated based on weight and destination</li>
                        <li>Expedited Shipping (2-3 business days): Available upon request</li>
                        <li>Priority/Overnight Shipping: Available upon request</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Processing Time</h3>
                    <p>
                        Orders are typically processed and shipped within 1-2 business days of payment 
                        receipt. You'll receive a tracking number once your order ships.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Packaging</h3>
                    <p>
                        We understand that box condition is important to collectors. All sets are 
                        packaged with extra cushioning and protective materials to minimize damage 
                        during shipping. Larger sets may be double-boxed for extra protection.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Returns Policy</h2>
                    <p>

                        with your order, we're here to help.
                    </p>
