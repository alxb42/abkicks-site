                    </p>

                    <h2>Return Eligibility</h2>

                    <h3>Non-Returnable Items</h3>

                        The following items are not eligible for return:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Return Process</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1: Contact Us</h3>
                    <p>
                        Email us at <a href="mailto:abkicksllc@gmail.com">abkicksllc@gmail.com</a> 
                        with the following information:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your order number</li>
                        <li>The item(s) you wish to return</li>
                        <li>Reason for return</li>
                        <li>Photos of the item (if applicable)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 2: Receive Authorization</h3>
                    <p>
                        We'll review your request and, if approved, provide you with:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Return Authorization (RA) number</li>
                        <li>Return shipping instructions</li>
                        <li>Our return address</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Please do not ship items back to us without first receiving a Return 
                        Authorization number.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Package and Ship</h3>
                    <p>
                        Carefully package the item(s) using appropriate protective materials. 
                        Include your RA number inside the package and write it clearly on the 
                        outside of the box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recommend using a trackable shipping method and purchasing shipping 
                        insurance. AB KICKS LLC is not responsible for returns lost or damaged 
                        in transit.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Inspection & Refund</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once we receive your return, we'll inspect the item(s) to ensure they meet 
                        our return eligibility criteria. This process typically takes 2-3 business 
                        days. We'll notify you by email once your return has been processed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Refunds</h2>
                    <h3>Refund Method</h3>
                    <p>
                        Refunds will be issued to your original payment method. Please allow 5-7 
                        business days for the refund to appear in your account, depending on your 
                        financial institution's processing time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Refund Amount</h3>
                    <p>
                        We'll refund the purchase price of the returned item(s). Original shipping 
                        costs are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error (wrong item 
                        sent, item arrived damaged, etc.).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Return Shipping Costs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the 
                        return is due to our error. In cases where we made a mistake, we'll provide 
                        a prepaid return label.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Exchanges</h2>
                    <p>
                        We currently do not offer direct exchanges. If you'd like a different item, 
                        please return the original item for a refund and place a new order for the 
                        item you want.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your item arrives damaged or defective, please contact us immediately 
                        with photos of:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The shipping box/packaging</li>
                        <li>The damaged item</li>
                        <li>Any visible damage to the LEGO® box</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We'll work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, either 
                        through a replacement (if available) or a full refund, including shipping costs.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Wrong Item Received</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you receive the wrong item, please contact us immediately. We'll arrange 
                        for the correct item to be sent to you at no additional charge and provide 
                        a prepaid return label for the incorrect item.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Late or Missing Returns</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you've sent a return and haven't received your refund within the expected 
                        timeframe, please:
